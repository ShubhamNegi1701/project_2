## Project description
**Background**

 - Since the middle of the 20th century, the **rapidly increasing global production of plastics** (322 million per year in 2016) has been accompanied by 
 - an **unprecedented accumulation of plastic litter in our oceans**. On average,  an  estimated  8  million  metric  tons of  this  persistent  material  enters  the  global  ocean  annually (Jambeck et al. 2015). 
 - Plastic litter **compromises the ecological and economic prosperity of the ocean**, with over 300 marine species being harmed annually through entanglement or ingestion (Gall &Thompson, 2015).
 - **Microplastics** are a concern to ocean health because they are ingested by marine plankton, move across food webs and like all plastic litter they can persist in the ocean for an extremely long time (hundreds of years).  
 - With the **world’s longest coastline**, this problem is of particular urgency for Canadians.


## Questions
Do we pollute more in the summer months?
Are the most populated cities the most polluted?
Is plastic waste growing the fastest? 

Dataset:
The Greate Canadian Shoreline Data.

Since 1994, the Great Canadian Shoreline Cleanup has collected over 1.7 million kg of trash across Canada’s shorelines over thousands of volunteer cleanup event. The dataset for this challenge provides three years of shoreline cleanup data across Canada.

## How to use code in this repository

this scrip contains 4 main jupyter notebooks:
1. Temporal analysis of total waste amount by year.ipynb: general temporal analysis of total waste.
2. Temporal analysis of total waste amount monthly in monthly_analysis.ipynb.
3. Monthly_analysis.ipynb: montly change of waste from 2017-2019.
4. Most_Common_Types_Of_Waste.ipynb: most common types of Waste comparison over time.
